### Two Leaf

Two-Leaf is a tea shop web app built with Eleventy and Nunjucks. I built this project as a first-year apprentice at Kittelberger Media Solutions, during the first three months of learning basic HTML and CSS.

Initially the project was intended to be designed for mobile view (360×800px) only, but towards the end of the project I also made other viewports usable. Some pages, like the homepage, are more or less responsive. Throughout the project you'll find components that are responsive and others that are not. A breakdown of all components and different layouts can be found under `https://davidokit.github.io/two-leaf/overview`.

The main goal of the project was not to create a finished site with filled content, but a modular toolbox of reusable components built following the atomic design methodology.

As I progress in my apprenticeship, I will likely return to this project to add interactivity and logic to certain components or pages using JavaScript.
